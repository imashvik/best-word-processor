<title>BEST Word Processor</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1 style="color:grey;">WHAT IS A WORD PROCESSOR ?</h1>
<p>A word processor is a device or software program capable of creating, storing, and printing text documents. It allows users to write and modify text, display it on a screen, save it electronically, and print it out.

Word processing software is one of the most common technology tools in the world, allowing users to create resumes and cover letters, business correspondence, blog posts, novels, and more.

Traditionally, word processors were computer applications downloaded to a specific number of computers. But as cloud computing has become more common, so have browser-based word processors. These typically lack the more advanced features of a traditional program; however, they offer more flexibility and the ability to collaborate in real time.</p>
<h2 style="color:indigo;">Some best word processor are</h2>
<h2 style="color:LightSkyBlue;">Microsoft Word</h2>
<p style="color:LightSkyBlue;">Used to make professional-quality documents, letters, reports, etc., MS Word is a word processor developed by Microsoft. It has advanced features which allow you to format and edit your files and documents in the best possible way. </p>
<h2 style="color:DarkTurquoise;">LIBRE OFFICE</h2>
<p style="color:DarkTurquoise;">finally we come to a full-fledged word processor that offers offline desktop apps and is totally available for free. LibreOffice is an open-source project that is compatible with Microsoft Word and other Office documents. It aims to bring all the powerful tools and features of popular word processors in a slick and modern user interface — all for free.Besides that, what gives LibreOffice the edge is that its code is much better optimized, thus making it lighter and faster. Also, LibreOffice is more actively developed and is the default office suite included with the majority of Linux distros. And just recently LibreOffice 7.1 was released with support for better compatibility with DOC/DOCX file format and new table and writing features. I would say, if you want a free word processor in 2022 that has desktop-level tools and features then LibreOffice is simply the best out there.</p>
<h2 style="color:Navy;">Google Docs</h2>
<p style="color:Navy;">Google Docs, first released in 2006, is a free web-based word processor in which documents can be created, edited and stored as part of the Google Docs Editors suite of free web applications. The cloud-based productivity platform also includes Google Sheets, Google Slides, Google Drawings, Google Forms, Google Sites and Google Keep.

Google Docs users can import, create, edit and update online documents in various fonts and file formats that can be accessed from any computer with an internet connection and web browser.

Users can also access documents from mobile devices with Android, Chrome or iOS operations systems, and create new documents to work on from their device</p>

<h2 style="color:teal;">Wps OFFICE</h2>
<p style="color:teal;">If you’ve used a modern version of Microsoft Word, there’ll be no learning curve when you switch to Writer – the word processing component of WPS Office Free.

This free word processor looks and behaves almost exactly like its premium counterpart, and even has its own equivalent of OneDrive, offering 1GB free cloud storage.

Its selection of pre-installed templates gives you everything you need for common document types, and you can easily create your own for bespoke tasks. It’s compatible with every text file format you can think of, including current and legacy versions of Microsoft Word dating back to Office 97.

WPS Office Writer is supported by discrete ads, which can be removed by upgrading to the premium version, but they’re barely noticeable and no features are locked behind a paywall. Overall, WPS Writer is very impressive, and in our opinion it’s the best free word processor available to download today.

WPS recently launched a free PDF to Word converter as well, which is a great companion to its word processor.</p>
